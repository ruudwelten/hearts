# Hearts Simulator Rules

* Three to six may play, but the game is best suited to four players.  
* The standard pack is used and an even distribution of cards is achieved by
  removing as many of the following as are needed: 2♣, 2♦, 2♠ and 3♣.  
* Cards rank in the normal order with Aces high.  
* After the deal each player selects three cards to pass them to another player.
  They must do so before viewing the cards they receive.  
  For the first deal, cards are discarded to the left. For the second deal,
  cards are passed to the right. In the third deal, cards are passed across the
  table and in the fourth deal, players 'hold' i.e. do not pass any cards.  

## Playing

Card play follows the normal rules:  
* The player holding the 2♣ leads the first trick with that card. In situations
  with 2♣ removed, play starts with 3♣ or 4♣ if 3♣ is also removed.  
* Players must follow suit if able; otherwise, they may play a card from any
  suit.  
* Neither hearts nor the Q♠ may be led until they have been "broken" (discarded
  on the lead of another suit), unless the player who must lead has nothing but
  Hearts or Q♠ in their hand.  
* The highest card of the led suit wins the trick, and the trick winner leads to
  the next.  

## Scoring

* Each heart card is 1 penalty point.  
* The Q♠ is 13 penalty points.  
* ~~Shooting the moon: A player may aim to capture all the penalty cards; i.e.,
  the Q♠ and all hearts. If they succeed, they score zero points, while each
  opponent scores twenty-six penalty points.~~ <- Not yet implemented  
* When the first player reaches 100 penalty points, the game stops and players
  settle their scores.
